"""Internal helpers for the read-only Agent tool modules (담당자 B).

This module is **not a tool** and is never placed in the tool registry. It holds
the two cross-cutting concerns the four read-only tools share, so each tool module
stays small, importable, and unit-testable *without* the Strands Agents SDK
installed and *without* 담당자 A's ``backend/shared`` package existing on disk:

1. :func:`tool` - a guarded re-export of Strands' ``@tool`` decorator. When the
   SDK is installed the real decorator turns the wrapped function into an Agent
   tool (auto-generating its spec from the signature/docstring). When the SDK is
   absent (e.g. the local Python 3.9 dev/test environment, where ``strands-agents``
   is only a TODO in ``requirements.txt``) it degrades to an identity decorator so
   the plain read logic remains directly callable.
2. :func:`resolve_db` - a **lazy** resolver for 담당자 A's read-only ``db`` helper.
   Importing ``shared.db`` is deferred to call time so the tool modules
   import cleanly even though ``backend/shared`` is 담당자 A's code and is not
   created in this repo (tests install a stub under ``shared.*``).

Design references: ``design.md`` -> "3. Agent Tools" / "주 실행 경로: 사전
조립(pre-assembly) 우선"; ``requirements.md`` -> Requirement 5.

Python 3.9 note: ``from __future__ import annotations`` keeps the builtin-generic
annotation style lazy so it resolves on the local 3.9 runtime.
